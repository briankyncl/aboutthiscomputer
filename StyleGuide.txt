CHARACTERS
  - Tabs should use spaces, not the tab character.

  - Single-quotes should be used for all code enclosures.
      [Example] Function('Parameter text.')

  - Double-quotes should only be used for passing to OS, or in user-readable text.
      [Example] Function('BatchCommand "parameter"')
      [Example] MsgBox('Hello, "world"!')

CODE FOLDING AND SPLITTING
  - Bodies of code more than (~5) lines should consider receiving a header/sub-header and indented to enable code folding.
  - Bodies of code more than (~1000) lines should consider being split into separate UDF files.

CODE WRAPPING
  - TODO

INDENTATION
  - Tab character should be space, not tab.
  - Tab spacing should be two (2) spaces.
  - Sections should be intended by (1) "tab" (two spaces).

COMMENTS
  - Overview: - Code remarks or otherwise intentional comments should use (2) semi-colons. 
              - Code that is temporarily commented out should use (1) semicolon.
              - Add comments to code as if you're looking at the code for the first time in two years and you're wondering what this does.

  - Functions should have an indented, all-caps title as the first line after the function is declared.
    The following line(s) should be a brief description of the function.
    Consider including the variables created by the function with sample output.
    [Example]
      Function()
        ;;THE EXAMPLE FUNCTION
        ;; This is the function that exists to be an example.
        ;;
        ;; $sFuncData -- Ex: "This is a string of text."

  - Section headers should use (2) semi-colons and be in all caps.
    [Example]
      ;;SECTION HEADER

  - Sub-section headers should use (2) semi-colons and be in sentence case or all lowercase
    [Example]
      ;;Section sub-header

  - Per-line comments should be (2) spaces from code, use (2) semi-colons, and be in sentence case or all lowercase.
    [Example]
      Function($sParameter)  ;;This is the per-line comment.

  - Code that is commented to temporarily disable it should use (1) semi-colon immediately before the code.
    [Example]
      ;Function($sParameter)

VARIABLES
  - Variables should start with a character describing the kind of data they contain.
    $iVariable  = Integer
    $sVariable  = String
    $bVariable  = Boolean
    $aVariable  = Array
    $lVariable  = List
    $idVariable = Element ID
    $hVariable  = Element handle
