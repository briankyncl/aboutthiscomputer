# About This Computer
About This Computer is a small utility for quickly and easily displaying useful information about a computer.
About This Computer lives in the system tray as a "gold star" icon. When clicked, it shows details such as computer name, IP address, uptime, etc.

## History
About This Computer was created to address one of the most common IT helpdesk scenarios: helping a call-in user provide the IP address of their computer. Over time, About This Computer has expanded to become a convenient location for displaying lots of details about a computer.
